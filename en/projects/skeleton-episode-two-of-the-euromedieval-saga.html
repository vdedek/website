We had drunk many a glass when something else caught our attention. Our gaze fell on several large stones lying under the yew tree. † Pepíček the parrot, October 25, 1995; † Zuzanka, April 4, 2002; † Zuzi 2 the rosy-faced, April 19, 2002; † Pepík, June 6, 2002.</em></div><div class="quote"><em>When I saw a greenish light under the yew tree coming from the other side of the garden, I crept closer and jumped up onto a branch. Two almost identical skeleton hamsters were arranging pebbles in a kind of ecstatic concentration on a floor plan drawn on the table. A parrot moved around the edge, squeaking its beak, shaking and rattling its bones as if protecting the table with this ritual dance, while two human skeletons traced Druidic runes on the 2020 tax return. A trickle of rosé wine ran through their empty bodies from time to time. There were five of them. They were preparing an exhibition.</em></div><div class="quote"><em>Loss of muscle through education, ossification through bureaucracy, emptying through mannerism, the death of meaning before it has been revealed. We gathered, the five of us necromancers, to give reality a second life – and oh, what a life: the green light will easily stir the tax haven sand-clogged bones of Brussels, illuminate the stubborn skull of the Czech art scene, and break the chains over the chicken graves of shopping malls fast-food.</em></div><div class="quote"><em>One of the basic motifs of Dragon's Lair, the Czech version of the RPG (Role-Playing-Game) Dungeons & Dragons, are ruins. They are a harbinger of danger and often become a lair for various monsters or a refuge for those who need to hide. The Dragon's Lair is basically set in a fantasy world, but the possibilities for RPGs are unlimited – from historical re-enactments to completely abstract worlds of other forms and laws. In the context of contemporary gender issues, the imaginative and fictional nature of the game allows for free permeability, enabling the creation of a whole spectrum of environments – from totally discriminatory to utopian-like tolerant. An important element is the setting of the game situation, i.e. where the game is actually played. Minimalist demand on game resources is undoubtedly an advantage of the game (a pencil, paper and a die will do), but further elaboration of the environment where the player sits can enhance immersion on the one hand, and on the other make the game experience more connected to the reality outside the game."</em></div><div class="body-text">Viktor Dedek and Jan Boháč</div>
