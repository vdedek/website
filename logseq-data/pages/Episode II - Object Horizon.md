	- Dominik Lang and Edith Jeřábková jointly run the sculpture studio at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. They perceive the notion of sculpture as a field of plastic forms, through the mapping and movement within it they understand and develop their own autonomous projects. With great respect for the history of the discipline, their medium is art itself and not just craftsmanship. Similarly, from a position of theory and practice, they are interested in the old or modernist tradition, the expanded field of sculpture and the contemporary simultaneously, including all their spatial assumptions.
	  
	  They introduced their collaborative work in the studio, which dates back to 2011, with the metaphor "Stín základního kamene". With the students, they seek to thoroughly reexamine the oft-defined essence of sculpture. At the same time, they also believe that looking at the foundation stone and classical principles is not enough. Therefore, they also focus their attention on its shadow, which changes its contours, size, intensity and application in the development of art. They reflect on how the shadow changes through the angle of view, the way it is illuminated and how much knowledge of the original basic shape is important in shaping its meaning. The form of teaching is enhanced by collaborative studio projects. The Sculpture Studio has produced the exhibitions and publication Lapidarium, the exhibitions Sculptor or Gardener and Art and Shadow, which confirm the functional and suggest other key perspectives on the medium of sculpture. The students and their supervisors established a parallel Collection - a living, open and changing sum of objects and shapes. The juxtaposition they create thereby defines the young artists' circle of interest; the format of the Collection refers to institutional relationships, and the Collection itself highlights the object (its shape and personal history) as the fundamental motto of sculpture.
	  Episode II: Horizon of the Object is the second in a series of exhibitions whose primary impetus was the establishment of the (studio) collection. The students were inspired by the actual process in the creation/formation of the collection - the reception of the objects. The possibility of a meaningful evaluation of the object submitted for inclusion in the collection is problematic, hence the necessity of verbalizing one's own relationship to the object, as is the notion of the legitimacy of the subsequent discussion. The relationship between word and object becomes fundamental. The necessity of communication (even with oneself) versus its absurdity in terms of subjective perceptions and direct experiences with objects - is the theme of the exhibition.
	  
	  The project belongs to a series of exhibitions at G99 Gallery based on collaboration with external curators. The dramaturgy is coordinated by František Kowolowski in order to present a wide range of contemporary current artistic expressions by artists of the youngest generation. The series of exhibitions at G99 in 2015 also provides a space for a current tendency in which the activities of curator, theorist and artist are intertwined.
