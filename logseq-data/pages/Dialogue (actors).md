- #### About the project
	- Performance for two actors taking place on the shores of a lake or pond. The actors, who once performed together in a production but haven't seen each other for years, stand on opposite sides of the water surface. The distance is precisely such that they hear the other speaking but cannot understand the words. Only occasionally, when the wind allows, they catch a word or a fragment of a sentence.
	- They conduct a dialogue without understanding each other. They speak continuously, they must not break character. They respond to lines they didn't hear, answer questions they didn't catch. Each constructs the other in their head – their responses, their intentions, their presence. At one moment they synchronize on lines from the play they once performed together, but soon diverge again into their own trajectories.
	- Spectators spontaneously find the only spot from which they can hear both actors – precisely in the middle, equidistant from both shores.
	- In some performances, the actors entered the water and swam, maintaining that critical distance of incomprehensibility.
