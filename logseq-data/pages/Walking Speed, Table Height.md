- #### Curatorial text by Eva Riebová:
	- Today I dreamed of an object. I remember it precisely. It was similar to the low tables they use for tea ceremonies. It was made of varnished light yellow wood.” – Viktor Dedek
	- The description of a dream is an opening line of Viktor Dedek’s literary text, which together with sculptural objects and video projections creates thoughtful and poetic exhibition.
	- The resultant installation operates in a multi-level space. Fully awake, Dedek walks through the memory path of his dreams, observing their environments from a number of angles: marshes covered in mist, metro stations, abandoned buildings reminiscent of market stalls. The artist has an entire collection of dream environments – or rather, a digital archive. Rather than having pencil and paper lying on his bedside table, Dedek records his dreams into 3D software immediately after waking up. The dream settings, which borrow aesthetic features from computer games and virtual reality, are then transferred to the gallery space. The table is the central motif of the exhibition. Dedek ascribes to it the symbolism of work, of a concentrated state, but also entertainment in the form of video games. The table is multiplied and transformed across the exhibition space. The workspace gradually transforms into less specific objects reminiscent of game-play elements: metal ramps, platforms, footbridges, arenas. Simply moving about in the exhibition space evokes movement in a virtual environment, the direction and progress of which is precisely delineated by its author, while the speed of movement and angle of sight can be determined by the visitor.
