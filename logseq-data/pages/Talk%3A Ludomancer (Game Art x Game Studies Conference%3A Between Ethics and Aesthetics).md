- #### Conference Context:
	- The one-day conference focused on critical perspectives on game studies and game art, bridging the fields of academic and artistic research. The program consisting of a keynote and a set of 10-minute presentations investigated the intersection of game studies and critical game art practice.
	- The thematic emphasis, 'Between Ethics and Aesthetics: Gameplay as an Aesthetic Practice,' invited both artistic and academic inquiry into critical topics such as enacting freedom in popular games, the aesthetic experience within player neoliberal subjectivity, player agency, phenomenological perspectives, and the relations between aesthetics and subjectivity.

- #### My Performance Talk:
	- A 15-20 minutes long performative talk prepared specially for this conference. I quickly summarize the course of my research in [[The Slippery Slope of Gaming Experience]], present its core idea, but in the process I arrive at the conclusion that it failed in practice - I change my mind, pick up the first of the three volumes of *The Correction* by Thomas Bernhard that are on the table, and address myself. I read adapted texts based on my [[Ludomancer]] exhibition.
