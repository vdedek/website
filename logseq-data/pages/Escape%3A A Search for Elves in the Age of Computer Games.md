- #### About the publication:
	- Published in **Klima n° 05 – Liquid Futures**, an issue approaching the aquatic universe, exploring the space of permanent composting, the various living and non-living entities in seas and oceans, as well as the myths and fantasies stemming from them.
	- The text comes from my audio work [The Last Advanced Movement Guide You Will Need](the-last-advanced-movement-guide-you-will-need.html) and flowcharts are based on my artistic research project [The Slippery Slope of Gaming Experience](the-slippery-slope-of-gaming-experience.html), examining the relationship between gaming, mythology, and escapism.
	- **Published by:** Les presses du réel
	- **Year:** 2022
	- **Context:** Liste Art Fair Basel, Switzerland
