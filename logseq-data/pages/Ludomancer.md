- #### Curatorial text by Petra Filipová:
	- > *Ludomancer, the title character and the focal point of Viktor Dedek's installation, seems to be introducing us to the world of past and future myths, but at the same time remains consciously trapped in the banality of today. The first part of this neologism refers to the environment of games and players (the Latin word ludus means game), the second to medieval necromancers and nigromancers, black priests who cast spells on the living and the dead. As a whole, however, it also evokes William Gibson's famous cyberpunk opus Neuromancer. And it is within this range of meaning that the untold stories of Dedek's installation circle. Archaic-futuristic stone chairs, an abandoned bar, a radio receiver from which the reflective thoughts of a ludomancer can be heard, but also quotations from Thomas Bernhard's novel The Correction and Gibson's Neuromancer.*

- #### About the project
- The exhibition took place in the gothic cellar of the Gočár Gallery in Pardubice, in the back of which was an abandoned bar from the 1990s. While this part is normally used as a storage space, it was made accessible for the purposes of this exhibition. The result was a space with several layers of time, which then became the setting for the site-specific exhibition.
- In the first room, the viewer came across a swivel chair made of massive, roughly hewn sandstone boulders. In the connecting corridor was a radio transmitter in the form of several printed circuit boards embedded in carved stone boxes. In the last room, that abandoned bar, was a radio receiver playing a thirty-minute audio piece. Prints of AI-generated photographs of forest clearings were subtly installed among the empty glasses on the shelves and in the drink menu.
- The audio work is an audiobook style narrative with interludes of stone keyboard samples. Heavily inspired by, and in many places quoting, T. Bernhard's novel . The narrative revolves around gaming, its possible liminal forms, its psychology and the psychology of the relationship between the game characters and the player characters themselves, escape, solitude, alienation, the relationship of gaming to the night, the non-formation of memory, the attempt to understand gaming, the attempt to stop - to stop with everything... Unlike the novel, here it is not clear what happened to the main character.
- > *"Ludomancer lives, we would say it survives as an idea. But it is much more than that. Ludomancer borrows players in the same way that players borrow game characters. It filters out all vestiges of identity and then glides across the smooth grey field of their consciousness. Like a waterstrider skimming the surface of a still pool."*
- > *"Everything I described is different. I don't know what I have created or destroyed, and I don't know what I have lost. Everything is always different, the character is always different.As long as we play, we can still exist in the highest tension. The end of the game is no process."*
