- #### About the project
	- A variation of the practical part of my diploma thesis, an installation / venue of a special event for a closed group of guests – my few friends with whom I play the computer game Dota 2.
	- This game takes place on only one map, which never changes and so players know the environment by heart – but this is only partially true. They know the environment in great detail from the player's point of view: they know its game usability, abstract qualities based on game mechanics – where to stand, which way to escape, where not to go, etc.
	- I left the player's bird's eye view and chose a specific place that has no game significance – a lantern with a bush at the side of the road. I looked at the place through the eyes of a passing pedestrian and made a real-world copy of it from materials obtained from the workers who were finishing the construction of the new school building.
	- I invited several teammates from Dota 2. Some I knew personally, some just virtually. As it was christmas, we met in the early evening for a glass of mulled wine. I showed them where the place was on the game-map.
	- Now, every time we play, each of us has this place on the map in every single match – the memory of a joint meeting in the real world embedded in the unchanging virtual game map.
