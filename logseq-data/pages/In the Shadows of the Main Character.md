- #### Text from the catalogue by Sandra Baborovská and Martin Netočný:
	- > Jan Boháč and Viktor Dedek use gallery institutions to organise participatory events. They construct their scenarios using mechanisms and principles found in Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPG). These events are usually dedicated to identitarian or climate topics, loosely connected to form a systematically developed series called the Eurostředověka saga (Euro-Medieval Saga). Jonáš Richter works with soundtracks and occasionally with moving images. He directs the listener's attention to the relationships between the content of the statements and the contexts in which they are made. He also tests how a statement's meaning is conditioned by its emotional colouring. He shares approaches to the critical analysis of social roles with Boháč and Dedek and occasionally collaborates with them.
	- > The installation *In the Shadows of the Main Character* (2024-2025) occupies one of the rooms at the Stone Bell House. Boháč, Dedek and Richter place a large object—a fragment from the mediated imaginary world and a kind of narrative focal point—at the centre of the room. Around it, six chairs are arranged and equipped with headphones. Each plays a part of an audio recording created during several performances in the same space. The environment is further enhanced by an atmospheric recording that resonates throughout the entire room.
	- > The participatory events that took place several times during the exhibition period are designed to explore the possibilities of embodying non-player characters (NPCs) through interactions between visitors, artists and architectural elements. Per the scenario, those who take part are deprived of their decision-making potential and confronted with the marginal themes and tasks typically encountered by NPCs in various video games. By recording and subsequently reproducing the events in the places where they originally happened, the trio of artists tests the possibilities for mediating these fragile existential shifts.
