	- Full-time dreamer and part-time trickster, Viktor Dedek is a quixotic regisseur of polyphonic worlds, suspended between the unlimited fantasy of a computer game and the unruled laws of imagination. The artist boldly reaches beyond the performative, towards the multi-sensorial experience of extended reality. Fictive narratives of phantom-like protagonists collide with the visual collages of phantasmagoric sites, loosely based upon a deceiving memory, non-identified cartographies of a lost mind. Dedek's universe is both a utopia of the unknown as well as the comfort zone of the artist's own self-confidence. Guardian of a cognitive labyrinth, the artist leads and misleads the viewer through the avenues of illusion (delusion?) and the theatrics of post-truth. Seemingly hard to grasp and hermetic, his conceptual practice mimics the vocabulary of computer-generated hyper worlds of super-human and alien tactics, challenging the perceptive skills and investigating human (in)ability to memorize, act and imagine. Dedek provokes the viewer, unsettling his/her experience of once familiar reality and setting up a doubt in the given idioms of today's world thus awakening a sensitivity of artificial intelligence and hardware logic of new minds yet to be mastered. Have we already moved to the land of a too well-known and predictable future, or do we keep inhabiting an extreme present of zwischendinge and deselfing? The artist is a post-romantic poet of a technocized reverie, an agent of a revised sublime for the (on-line) age of inevitable humanitarian decline.
