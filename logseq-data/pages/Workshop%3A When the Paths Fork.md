- #### Anotace
	- The theme of infinity is used in the stories in various forms and on various levels. Infinity refers not only to time, but also to space and possibilities. The infinite space of the universe, in which the protagonist of a science fiction novel floats, is similar to the space of infinite possibilities in which the writer moves while creating the story. At any given moment, the story can continue in infinite ways. What if we didn't have the constraints of a classical narrative where the author always opts for only one possibility? But the story can't go on in ten ways at once, can it? To explore these questions, we'll use Twine, a program that allows us to write branching stories. You may be familiar with the format of a [[game/book]], a book in which the reader chooses how the story continues by selecting from several options. Or you may be familiar with similar situations from other media, such as computer games. Twine can be used to prepare a story for both of these formats. And anyone who wants to can implement simple programming and work with the story as a set of rules and variables.
