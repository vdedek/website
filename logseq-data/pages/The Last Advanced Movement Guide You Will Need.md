- At the heart of Viktor Dedek‘s performance - The Last Advanced Movement Guide You Will Need - is the world of computer game players, especially their specific relationship to time, space and movement.
  The eight-channel installation, in the form of a 3d-sound tunnel, presents three intersecting audio essays over a 50 minute period. They address the nature of the **gamer‘s memory** - the (in)possibility to return -, they make the listener feel **the safety of the island of the eternal Now**, which is what the game for many players becomes, and finally they reveal the **complexity of movement in a virtual environment**.
  The audio itself consists of in-game environmental sounds, parts of recorded gameplays, voice over and other types of sounds that are combined together inside a 3D sound engine for the site-specific installation.
  Performance was shown at Osmoza studio in Ljubljana and City Surfer Office in Prague.
