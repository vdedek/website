- #### About the work:
	- The characters in Raymond Chandler's novels act along the line of clearly determined roles, similar to the actors in theater plays. Contrary to the latter, however, the text of the novel is not straightforwardly structured. The character is being put together during the process of reading and so is the reader also its performer. Individual lines of the dialogues, their vocabulary and the stylistics, as well as the descriptions of rooms, the names of streets and the qualities of the readers themselves and their momentary situation and condition – all this meets in one unique body.
	- During the exhibition, a professional actress performed hourly performances trying to capture this character-figure without leaving the original text, using correction tape to work with the physical book.

- #### Exhibition Context:
	- The work was part of the group exhibition **"Medium: Figure"** at Prague City Gallery (GHMP, Colloredo-Mansfeld Palace), curated by Sandra Baborovská. The exhibition presented contemporary Czech and Slovak artists working with the subject of figure as a medium, including works ranging from sculpture to video, film, photography, installation and performance. The exhibition loosely continued the successful project "Unsettled Figure. Expression in Czech Sculpture 1880–1914."
